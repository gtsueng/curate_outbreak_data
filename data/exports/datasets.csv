This virus first reported in 2019 and now spreading from Wuhan, China, the primary location outbreak. The protein sequence was determined based on the data from the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus genome (NCBI genome ID MN908947, GenBank: MN908947.3) published by Wu Et al. (LOCUS MN90894, 23-JAN-2020) by multiple sequences alignments with known SARS proteases. Aligning the sequence region of 2019-nCoV, “orf1ab polyprotein“ with the sequence of PDB 5N5O, the SARS main protease deposited by Zhang and Hilgenfeld in 2017 yield a protease with 306 amino acids. The sequence identity compared to 2H2Z, another SARS crystal structure, published by the Rao lab in 2006 is 96.1 %, similarity is 98.7 % with 100% aligned residues.

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.</p>","2019-nCoV,Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified,Biotechnology,Cancer,Chemical Sciences not elsewhere classified,Computational  Biology,Ecology,Immunology,Infectious Diseases,Medicine,Microbiology,Space Science,Virology,Wuhan pneumonia,epidemiology,intestine,swabs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). This decade’s first CoV, named 2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as ‘Public Health Emergency of International Concern’ on January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.</p>","2019-nCoV,Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified,Biotechnology,Coronavirus,Ecology,Environmental Sciences not elsewhere classified,Evolutionary Biology,Infectious Diseases,Medicine,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV,Public Health Emergency,Science Policy,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV,Virology,genetic analyses,reservoir host,therapeutics,vaccines,zoonoses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1245,figshare12019035,How blood group A might be a risk and blood group O be protected from SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infections (how the virus invades the human body via ABO(H) blood group carbohydrates).,"<p></p><p>Infection does not mean disease because for
uncountable reasons the invasion of a pathogen does not always lead to disease
symptoms. The
molecular biology of a virus infection pathogenesis determines the genetic
target and the human phenotype-determining enzymes decide about the difference between infection and disease. In the case that <i>O</i>-glycosylation
plays a key role in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections, as was discussed
already 14 years ago in a SARS-CoV virus infection and is currently again predicted for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, this would involve the formation of hybrid, serologically
A-like, <i>O</i>-GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr-R, Tn (“T
nouvelle”) antigenic structures. Although the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2) protein
is defined as the primary SARS-CoV receptor, it is the history of the amino acid serine, suggesting the actual or additional binding via an intermediate hybrid <i>O</i>-glycan: the TMPRSS2 (transmembrane
protease serine subtype 2) host protease-mobilized, virus-encoded serine molecule gets access to the host's N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) metabolism and the resulting intermediate, hybrid A-like/Tn structure performs the
adhesion of the virus to host cells primarily independent of the ABO blood
group, while the phenotype-determining sugars become the final glycosidic target. Individuals with blood
group A and B cannot respond with preformed innate antibodies to the synthesis of A-like/Tn structures due to phenotypic accommodation of plasma
proteins but perform a further (blood group-A- and/or B-specific) hybrid binding, most
likely causing autoimmune reactions. A first statistical
study suggests that people with blood group A have a significantly higher risk
for acquiring COVID-19, whereas people with blood group O have a significantly
lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups (Zhao, J. <i>et al., 2020). </i>SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) infections may
be considered an evolutionary selective disease, contributing to the present-day world distribution of the human ABO(H)
blood groups, which has arisen through blood group-related life-threatening
diseases<sup> </sup>over millions of
years. While the synthesis of
the blood group AB enables the strongest contact with a pathogen and molecularly
precluding any isoagglutinin activity, makes this group the least protected and
the smallest among the ABO blood groups, blood group O(H) individuals develop
the least contact with the pathogen; maintaining the isoagglutinins, they rarer
develop severe disease and survive this coevolution in an immunological balance
with a pathogen as the largest blood group worldwide. However, it might be speculated that for an unknown period of time they remain pathogen carriers and belong to the main drivers of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</p><p><i><br></i></p><p></p><p><b>Reference</b>: Zhao, J. <i>et al.</i> Relationship between the ABO Blood Group and the COVID-19 Susceptibility. <i>medRxiv</i> (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096.<br></p><p></p><p>

However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients’ lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.</p>","Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified,COVID-19,Cancer,Cell Biology,Ecology,Genetics,Immunology,Infectious Diseases,Medicine,Microbiology,Virology,cytokine,inflammation,lymphopenia,transcriptome profiling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1292,figshare12082035,The codon usage pattern of the novel coronavirus,"<p><b> </b>The
current outbreak of a novel <a>coronavirus </a>(severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is spreading rapidly
across the whole world. The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus
diseases (COVID-19) to be a global pandemic. COVID-19 is milder, less fatal
than SARS and MERS, but SARS-CoV-2 poses more serious threats to public health,
because it is highly contagious and has a high potential of causing severe-acute,
life-threatening pneumonia. Here we analyzed
the similarities of codon usages between humans and different viruses, including
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and coronavirus (CoV). The codon usages of HPAIs are highly
similar to that of humans. In contrast, the codon usage of HIVs and CoVs is
less and the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 is the least similar to that of humans among
all viruses tested. Besides, human-preferred codons are
adopted to substitute less-preferred ones in SARS-CoV; in SARS-CoV-2,
however, human-preferred codons are replaced by less-preferred ones.
The unique codon usage pattern suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was probably formed by evolving in
an unusual intermediate host over a long period, in which its codon usage became drastically
different from that of humans and those of other pathogenic viruses. Moreover, its pathogenicity is weakened
compared with SARS-CoV, but it becomes more potent and may gain higher potentials in the future. Therefore, there is an urgent need to block the transmission
routes among humans, search for the origin and intermediate hosts of the coronaviruses,
and prevent any future outbreaks.</p><br>","Bioinformatics,COVID-19,Genetics,HIV,Infectious Diseases,MERS,Microbial Genetics,Molecular Biology,Molecular Evolution,SARS,SARS-CoV-2,codon usage,highly pathogenic avian influenza,human immunodeficiency virus,novel coronavirus,pathogenic viruses,severe acute respiratory syndrome",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All countries in the world are racing against time to fight the spread and deadly effects of this virus. This paper is a short meta analysis (short/rapid communications) literature review of COVID-19 / NCOV / Corona Virus in the Scopus, Dimensions, Lens, and Europe PMC database. We aim to find out the profile of publications about Corona Virus in the world, and do a short assessment using the principles of open access in knowledge distribution. The method used is literature review using commercial and non-commercial databases which are then visualized using simple spreadsheets software. The results of this study indicate that non-commercial databases also need to be used by researchers because they contain a much larger number of documents than major commercial databases. The majority of publications are peer reviewed articles in prestige journals (indicated by a high JIF). Gold OA and hybrid journals are generally chosen although the cost of publication (APC) is very expensive (up to USD 5000). The next option would be a non-OA association journal (eg: JAMA). The research itself was carried out by a small number of countries: Asia (China, Japan, India), the US, Europe (UK and Germany), and Saudi Arabia. When linked to the urgency of a pandemic disaster, COVID-19 research, especially those carried out in under-represented countries, needs to maximize the publicity via public repositories (Green OA route) under supervision of research communities to jointly review and test the validity. Publication via journal can be done as a later step.</p>Keywords: COVID-19, pandemic, open access, prestige journal, knowledge distribution","COVID19,Corona Virus,Openscience,Science Policy,Self archiving,bibliometric analysis,corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19,knowledge distribution,pengarsipan mandiri,sains terbuka,sains terbuka indonesia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the RNA-binding N terminal domain (NTD) of the N protein was targeted for the identification of possible inhibitors of RNA binding. Two NTD structures of N proteins were selected (2OFZ and 1SSK, 92% homology) for virtual screening of 56,079 compounds from Asinex and Maybridge library to identify top 15 hits for each of the targets based on ‘docking score’. These top-hits were further screened for MM-GBSA binding free energy, pharmacokinetic properties (QikProp) and drug-likeness (SwissADME) and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Two suitable binders (ZINC00003118440 and ZINC0000146942) against the target 2OFZ were identified. ZINC00003118440 is a theophylline derivative under the drug class ‘bronchodilators’ and further screening with approved bronchodilators was also studied to identify their ability to bind to the RNA binding region on the N protein. The other identified top hit is ZINC0000146942, which is a 3,4dihydropyrimidone class molecule. Hence this study suggests two important class of compounds, theophylline and pyrimidone derivaties as possible inhibitors of RNA binding to the N terminal domain of N protein of coronavirus, thus opening new avenues for in vitro validations.</p> <p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Recent studies reported lymphocytopenia in these patients, while also observed expansions of antigen-specific T/B cells during early-recovery stage. Here we conducted an in-depth immune profiling of 16 early-recovery patients using single-cell RNA-seq, HLA-genotyping and deep immune repertoire sequencing. Our analysis revealed a number of COVID-19-specific TCR groups, and identified statistically-confident antigenic epitopes from the virus genome. Further, we uncovered over 74,000 clonally expanded B cell groups with somatic hypermutations and/or class switch recombination. Molecular dynamics simulations on highly expanded groups revealed a number of antibodies with potentially high binding affinity to the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein. Finally, an elevated fraction of monocytic Myeloid-derived suppressor cells was observed in patients with combined bacterial infections. Together, we expect our findings to provide immediate therapeutic candidates against the pandemic of COVID-19.</p>","COVID-19,Cancer,Developmental Biology,Genetics,Immune repertoire profiling,Immunology,Infectious Diseases,Medicine,Microbiology,Single cell sequencing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1304,figshare12111570,Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2,"<p><b>Background:</b> Effective
therapeutics to treat COVID-19 are urgently needed. Remdesivir is a nucleotide
prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses. Here, we
tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2
infection.</p>

<p><b>Methods:</b> To
evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we
used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that
results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus
macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir
or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and
histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy
to determine treatment efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Results:</b> In
contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not
show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs.
Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as
12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after
inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly
lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue.</p>

<b>Conclusions: </b>Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques.

Recent studies reported lymphocytopenia but also expansions of antigen-specific T/B cells during early-recovery stage. Here we investigated 16 early-recovery patients using scRNA-seq, HLA-genotyping and deep immune repertoire profling. Our analysis revealed 916 COVID-19-specific TCR groups enriched for a novel cytotoxic CD8+ phenotype with both resident memory (ZNF683+) and tissue exit (SIRP5) markers, and identified 114 statistically-confident virus epitopes. Further, we uncovered 374 BCR groups with somatic hypermutations and/or class switch recombinations. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed 15% of the highly expanded groups may serve as neutralizing antibodies against the virus Spike protein. Finally, we discovered that bacterial infection in COVID-19 patients may elevate monocytic myeloidderived suppressor cells via TLR4/NF!B signaling and cause disease aggravation. Together, we expect our findings and immune-receptor datasets to provide immediate therapeutic options against the pandemic of COVID-19.</p>","Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified,COVID-19,Cancer,Immune repertoire profiling,Immunology,Infectious Diseases,Medicine,Single cell sequencing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rational use requires: (1) modification of the clozapine package insert worldwide to include lower doses for Asians and to avoid the lethality associated with pneumonia, (2) the use of clozapine levels for personalizing dosing, and (3) the use of slow and personalized titration. This may make clozapine as safe as possible and contribute to increased life expectancy and well-being. In the absence of data on COVID-19 in clozapine patients, clozapine possibly impairs immunological mechanisms and may increase pneumonia risk in infected patients. Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose. If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it. Once the signs of inflammation and fever have disappeared, the clozapine dose can be slowly increased to the prior dosage level.","Asian continental ancestry group/genetics,COVID-19,Clozapine, blood,Clozapine/adverse effects,Clozapine/metabolism,Clozapine/toxicity,Drug labeling,Infection,Inflammation,Medicine,Mortality/drug effects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1315,figshare12141897,COVID-Predictor: RNA Sequence based Prediction of Coronavirus,"The problem of virus classification is always a subject of concern for virology or epidemiology over the decades. Moreover, the detection of highly divergent or yet unknown viruses is a major challenge despite of its clinical importance. In this situation, the outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its susceptibility in different epidemic condition around the world clearly suggest that the virus is mutating to create divergent variants and making the task of virus prediction more challenging. On the other hand, despite of novel coronavirus, two more coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS-CoV-1 are already present. Therefore, the use of machine learning technique is highly required at this moment to predict the coronaviruses by considering their divergent genetic functional characteristics. Thus, we are proposing machine learning based coronavirus prediction technique, called COVID-Predictor, where 1000 of RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-1, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 and other virus are used to train a Naïve Bayes classifier so that it can predict any unknown sequence of these viruses. In order to develop the COVID-Predictor, the feature vector is constructed by the motifs of the sequence generated by k-mer and n-gram techniques. The model has been validated using 10 fold cross validation in comparison with other classification techniques. The results show the superiority of our predictor by achieving average 97\% accuracy on unseen validation set. The same pre-trained model has been used to design a web based application where RNA sequences of unknown viruses can be uploaded to predict class of coronavirus.The predictor, code and datasets are available here: http://www.nitttrkol.ac.in/indrajit/projects/COVID-Predictor/","Bioinformatics,Bioinformatics Software,COVID-19,Coronavirus,Health Informatics,MERS,Machine Learning,Pattern Recognition and Data Mining,RNA Sequence,SARS,SARS-CoV-2,k-mer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main protease (M<sup>Pro</sup>) plays a critical role in viral replication and maturation, thus can serve as the primary drug target. To understand the structural evolution of M<sup>Pro</sup>, we have performed phylogenetic and Sequence Similarity Network analysis, that depicted divergence of Coronaviridae M<sup>Pro</sup> in five clusters specific to viral hosts. This clustering was corroborated with the comparison of M<sup>Pro</sup> structures. Furthermore, it has been observed that backbone and binding site conformations are conserved despite variation in some of the residues. These attributes can be exploited to repurpose available viral protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>Pro</sup>. In agreement with this, we performed screening of ∼7100 molecules including active ingredients present in the Ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines, anti-viral phytochemicals and synthetic anti-virals against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>Pro</sup> as the primary target. We identified several natural molecules like δ-viniferin, myricitrin, taiwanhomoflavone A, lactucopicrin 15-oxalate, nympholide A, afzelin, biorobin, hesperidin and phyllaemblicin B that strongly binds to SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>Pro</sup>. Intrestingly, these molecules also showed strong binding with other potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection like viral receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We anticipate that our approach for identification of multi-target-directed ligand will provide new avenues for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p> <p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Nowadays, the world encounters a huge health crisis by the COVID-19 viral infection. Nucleotide inhibitors gave a lot of promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral infections. In this work, molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations are used to build a model for the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and test its binding affinity to some clinically approved drugs and drug candidates. Molecular dynamics is used to equilibrate the system upon binding calculations to ensure the successful reproduction of previous results, to include the dynamics of the RdRp, and to understand how it affects the binding. The results show the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Cefuroxime, Tenofovir, and Hydroxychloroquine, in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. There is an urgent need to specify drugs that can selectively bind and subsequently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The availability of a punch of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs can help us in this mission, aiming to reduce the danger of COVID-19. The compounds 2 and 3 may tightly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and so may be successful in the treatment of COVID-19.</p> <p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

1354,figshare12219572,Table_1_Covid-19: A Dynamic Analysis of Fatality Risk in Italy.xlsx,"<p>Italy was the second country in the world to face a wide epidemic of Covid-19 after China. The ratio of the number of fatalities to the number of cases (case fatality ratio, CFR) recorded in Italy was surprisingly high and increased in the month of March. The older mean age of population, the changes in testing policy, and the methodological computation of CFR were previously reported as possible explanations for the incremental trend of CFR, a parameter theoretically expected to be constant. In this brief report, the official data provided by the Italian Ministry of Health were analyzed using fitting models and the linear fit method approach. This last methodology allowed us to reach two findings. The trend of the number of deaths followed a 1–3-day delay of positive cases. This delay was not compatible with a biological course of Covid-19 but was compatible with a health management explanation. The second finding is that the Italian number of deaths did not increase linearly with the number of positive cases, but their relationship could be modeled by a second-order polynomial function. The high number of positive cases might have a direct and an indirect effect on the number of deaths, the latter being related to the overwhelmed bed capacity of intensive care units.</p>","Corona virus,Dermatology,Emergency Medicine,Family Care,Foetal Development and Medicine,Gastroenterology and Hepatology,Geriatrics and Gerontology,Intensive Care,Medical Genetics (excl.

1370,figshare12253919,Why has the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Africa been insignificant compared to other regions? A descriptive analysis,"<p>Method</p>

<p>The dataset contains several confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, and death rate in six regions. The objective of the study is to compare the number of confirmed cases in Africa to other regions. </p>

<p>Death rate = Total number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the Total Number of infected patients.</p>

<p>The study provides evidence for the country-level in six regions by the World Health Organisation's classification.</p>

<p>Findings</p>

<p>Based on the descriptive data provided above, we conclude that the lack of tourism is one of the key reasons why COVID-19 reported cases are low in Africa compared to other regions. We also justified this claim by providing evidence from the economic freedom index, which indicates that the vast majority of African countries recorded a low index for a business environment. On the other hand, we conclude that the death rate is higher in the African region compared to other regions. This points to issues concerning health-care expenditure, low capacity for testing for COVID-19, and poor infrastructure in the region.</p>

<p>Apart from COVID-19, there are significant pre-existing diseases, namely; Malaria, Flu, HIV/AIDS, and Ebola in the continent. This study, therefore, invites the leaders to invest massively in the health-care system, infrastructure, and human capital in order to provide a sustainable environment for today and future generations. Lastly, policy uncertainty has been a major issue in determining a sustainable development goal on the continent. This uncertainty has differentiated Africa to other regions in terms of stepping up in the time of global crisis.</p>

This is a question that billions of people are wondering early 2020 due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This virus can produce a severe pneumonia that has killed over 230,000 people so far, was detected for the first time late 2019 in Wuhan (China), and has spread all over the world due, in part, to the difficulty of detecting and isolating asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic cases. In this paper, we explore how long suppression strategies (i.e., home confinement and social distancing) must be put into practice in highly populated cities to reduce the chances that a quick rebound of COVID-19 infections occur again over the next months. This is explored, using New York City (USA), San Francisco (USA), and Madrid (Spain) as case studies, through a simple but realistic Monte Carlo stochastic model that takes into account that part of the undetected infected individuals remain in circulation propagating the virus. Our simulations reflect that, if suppression strategies are not properly applied, they can be counterproductive because there are high chances that the confinement time has to be lengthened without reducing the total number of infections. We also estimate that, in the most conservative scenario and under the model assumptions, home confinement is effective if applied at least ~110 days in New York City, ~80 days in San Francisco, and ~70 days in Madrid, i.e., until mid-July 2020, early June 2020, and late May 2020, respectively.</p>","Applied Physics,Astrophysics,Biophysics,COVID-19,Classical Physics not elsewhere classified,Classical and Physical Optics,Cloud Physics,Computational Physics,Condensed Matter Physics,Condensed Matter Physics not elsewhere classified,High Energy Astrophysics; Cosmic Rays,Mathematical Physics not elsewhere classified,Mesospheric, Ionospheric and Magnetospheric Physics,Particle Physics,Photonics, Optoelectronics and Optical Communications,Physical Chemistry not elsewhere classified,Physical Chemistry of Materials,Plasma Physics,Quantum Physics not elsewhere classified,Solar System, Solar Physics, Planets and Exoplanets,Space and Solar Physics,Tropospheric and Stratospheric Physics,confinement time,coronavirus,quick rebound,stochastic model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCG vaccine has been extensively used to protect against tuberculosis for almost a 100 years. Interestingly, this vaccine reduces children's mortality caused by infections unrelated to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, a phenomenon thought to be due to the induction of trained immunity. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected, as of April 22, 2020, 2,623,231 people globally, causing a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, no vaccine or treatment is available to control this pandemic. We analyzed the number of positive cases and deaths in different countries and correlated them with the inclusion of BCG vaccination at birth in their national vaccination programs. Interestingly, those countries where BCG vaccination is given at birth have shown a lower contagion rate and fewer COVID-19-related deaths, suggesting that this vaccine may induce trained immunity that could confer some protection for SARS-CoV-2.</p>","Animal Immunology,Applied Immunology (incl.

In this original research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm.</p><p>Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analyzed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics.</p><p>Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve, we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6 and 99.5%, respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the ICT was found at CT <22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations.</p><p>Conclusion: The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 min at the peak of the pandemic. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently-used molecular techniques.</p>","COVID-19,Dermatology,Emergency Medicine,Family Care,Foetal Development and Medicine,Gastroenterology and Hepatology,Geriatrics and Gerontology,Intensive Care,Medical Genetics (excl.

The lack of targeted therapeutics and limited treatment options have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or small molecule therapeutics against various targets of SARS-CoV-2. The main protease (Mpro) is a well characterized and attractive drug target because of its crucial role in processing of the polyproteins which are required for viral replication. In order to provide potential lead molecules against the Mpro for clinical use, we docked a set of 65 bioactive molecules of Tea plant followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of protein-ligand complexes by long term molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (1.50 µs). Top three bioactive molecules (Oolonghomobisflavan-A, Theasinensin-D, and Theaflavin-3-O-gallate) were selected by comparing their docking scores with repurposed drugs (Atazanavir, Darunavir, and Lopinavir) against SARS-CoV-2. Oolonghomobisflavan-A molecule showed a good number of hydrogen bonds with Mpro and higher MM-PBSA binding energy when compared to all three repurposed drug molecules. during the time of simulation.

For example, by removing air pollutants trees contribute to fewer health impacts, and tree cover expansion could extend these benefits by targeting the most polluted areas and vulnerable populations. To support strategic tree expansion, this research created urban tree cover maps using the 2017 NASA MOD44B satellite 250 m pixel product for 35 megacities, areas with large levels of pollution and vulnerable populations. Estimates of tree cover from photo-interpretation (PI) were used to characterize map error, city-wide, and from low to high tree cover, using 21 bins from 0 to 100% tree cover. Map accuracy was highest when MOD44B percent tree cover was combined with its tree cover standard deviation product, with average difference of 1.8% compared with PI estimates of 19.9% city-wide tree cover. MOD44B estimates of tree cover spatial patterns had strong explanatory value. The maps explained the PI estimates of low to high tree cover at 5% tree cover intervals with an R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97. The Getis Ord Gi<sup>*</sup> statistic determined a non-random spatial distribution of tree cover within the megacities, with significant clustering into hot spots of relatively high tree cover and cold spots of relatively low tree cover. Tree cover hot spots were most often furthest from downtown, at the rural-urban interface or within higher elevation terrain. Tree cover cold spots were most often in areas of concentrated development and along traffic corridors known for high levels of particulate matter and other air pollutants that could be reduced by trees. Given small increases in exposure to particulate matter are associated with significant increases in death rates from viruses, and that climate change and associated heat waves are forecast to exacerbate health risks to air pollution, we need to improve global urban tree cover. These map products can be used to expand tree cover that strategically contributes to pollutant abatement, human well-being, and sustainable cities.</p>","Architectural Science and Technology (incl.

1412,figshare12327923,Supplementary Material for: Localization of Cell Receptor-Related Genes of SARS-CoV-2 in the Kidney through Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has been responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, uses the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming. Meanwhile, the presence of B<sup>0</sup>AT1 (SLC6A19) may prevent TMPRSS2 from accessing the cutting position on ACE2. Identifying the expression of these cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in various tissues, especially in the kidney. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney. <b><i>Results:</i></b> ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells. TMPRSS2 was widely expressed in several renal tubule populations extending from the PT cells to the collection system cell type, of which intercalated cells and the distal convoluted tubule cells showed more significant expression than PT cells. Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression. Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung. These 3 types of cells demonstrated significant differences in the distribution of the cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2, which may indicate the diversity of cell surface structures and differences in the affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and cells.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2,Medicine,Proximal tubule cells,SARS-CoV-2,Single-cell transcriptome sequencing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outbreak of COVID-19 has attracted the attention of the whole world. Our study aimed to describe illness progression and risk profiles for mortality in non-survivors.</p><p>Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 155 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and focused on 18 non-survivors among them. Briefly, we compared the dynamic profile of biochemical and immune parameters and drew an epidemiological and clinical picture of disease progression from disease onset to death in non-survivors. The survival status of the cohort was indicated by a Kaplan–Meier curve.</p><p>Results. Of the non-survivors, the median age was 73.5 years, and the proportion of males was 72.2%. Five and 13 patients were hospital-acquired and community-acquired infection of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The interval between disease onset and diagnosis was 8.5 days (IQR, [4–11]). With the deterioration of disease, most patients experienced consecutive changes in biochemical parameters, including lymphopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, as well as elevated D-dimer and procalcitonin. Regarding the immune dysregulation, patients exhibited significantly decreased T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, including CD3<sup>+</sup>T, CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>Th, and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>Tc cells. By the end of the disease, most patients suffered from severe complications, including ARDS (17/18; 94.4%), acute cardiac injury (10/18; 55.6%), acute kidney injury (7/18; 38.9%), shock (6/18; 33.3%), gastrointestinal bleeding (1/18; 5.6%), as well as perforation of intestine (1/18; 5.6%). All patients died within 45 days after the initial hospital admission with a median survivor time of 13.5 days (IQR, 8–17).</p><p>Conclusions. Our data show that patients experienced consecutive changes in biochemical and immune parameters with the deterioration of the disease, indicating the necessity of early intervention.</p>","COVID-19,Dermatology,Emergency Medicine,Family Care,Foetal Development and Medicine,Gastroenterology and Hepatology,Geriatrics and Gerontology,Intensive Care,Medical Genetics (excl.

Specific control measures restricting social contacts were introduced by the Italian government starting from the beginning of March. In the current study we analyzed public data from the four most affected Italian regions. We (i) estimated the time-varying reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>), the average number of secondary cases that each infected individual would infect at time t, to monitor the positive impact of restriction measures; (ii) applied the generalized logistic and the modified Richards models to describe the epidemic pattern and obtain short-term forecasts. We observed a monotonic decrease of R<sub>t</sub> over time in all regions, and the peak of incident cases ~2 weeks after the implementation of the first strict containment measures. Our results show that phenomenological approaches may be useful to monitor the epidemic growth in its initial phases and suggest that costly and disruptive public health controls might have had a positive impact in limiting the Sars-Cov-2 spread in Northern Italy.</p>","Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health,Aged Health Care,COVID-19,Care for Disabled,Community Child Health,Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety,Epidemiology,Family Care,Health Care Administration,Health Counselling,Health Information Systems (incl.

Laboratory findings have been only partially described in some observational studies. To date, more comprehensive systematic reviews of laboratory findings on COVID-19 are missing. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis to assess laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19. Observational studies from three databases were selected. We calculated pooled proportions and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using the random-effects model meta-analysis. A total of 1106 articles were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI (China), and other sources. After screening, 28 and 7 studies were selected for a systematic review and a meta-analysis, respectively. Of the 4,663 patients included, the most prevalent laboratory finding was increased C-reactive protein (CRP; 73.6%, 95% CI 65.0–81.3%), followed by decreased albumin (62.9%, 95% CI 28.3–91.2%), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (61.2%, 95% CI 41.3–81.0%), decreased eosinophils (58.4%, 95% CI 46.5–69.8%), increased interleukin-6 (53.1%, 95% CI 36.0–70.0%), lymphopenia (47.9%, 95% CI 41.6–54.9%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 46.2%, 95% CI 37.9–54.7%).

Currently there are no approved drugs for the treatment of coronaviral disease (COVID-19), although some of the drugs have been tried. Chloroquine is being widely used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine, the derivative of Chloroquine shows better inhibition than Chloroquine and has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 also used to treat COVID-19. To study the interactions of Chloroquine and derivatives of Chloroquine with SARS-CoV-2, series of computational approaches like pharmacophore model, molecular docking, MM_GBSA study and ADME property analysis are explored. The pharmacophore model and molecular docking study are used to explore the structural properties of the compounds and the ligand-receptor (<b>PDB_ID: 6LU7</b>) interactions respectively. MM_GBSA study gives the binding free energy of the protein-ligand complex and ADME property analysis explains the pharmacological property of the compounds. The resultant best molecule (<b>CQD15)</b> further subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study which explains the protein stability (RMSD), ligand properties as well as protein-ligand contacts. Outcomes of the present study conclude with the molecule <b>CQD15</b> which shows better interactions for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine.</p> <p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

1447,figshare12366461,Repurposing approved drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein from molecular modeling and virtual screening,"<p>Herein, molecular modeling techniques were used with the main goal to obtain candidates from a drug database as potential targets to be used against SARS-CoV-2. This novel coronavirus, responsible by the COVID-19 outbreak since the end of 2019, became a challenge since there is not vaccine for this disease. The first step in this investigation was to solvate the isolated S-protein in water for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, being observed a transition from “up” to “down” conformation of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein with angle of 54.3 and 43.0 degrees, respectively. The RBD region was more exposed to the solvent and to the possible drugs due to its enhanced surface area. From the equilibrated MD structure, virtual screening by docking calculations were performed using a library contained 9091 FDA approved drugs. Among them, 24 best-scored ligands (14 traditional herbal isolate and 10 approved drugs) with the binding energy below –8.1 kcal/mol were selected as potential candidates to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, preventing the human cell infection and their replication. For instance, the ivermectin drug (present in our list of promise candidates) was recently used successful to control viral replication <i>in vitro.</i> MD simulations were performed for the three best ligands@S-protein complexes and the binding energies were calculated using the MM/PBSA approach. Overall, it is highlighted an important strategy, some key residues, and chemical groups which may be considered on clinical trials for COVID-19 outbreak. </p> <p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

1452,figshare12376121,Data_Sheet_1_Textile Masks and Surface Covers—A Spray Simulation Method and a “Universal Droplet Reduction Model” Against Respiratory Pandemics.docx,"<p>The main form of COVID-19 transmission is via “oral-respiratory droplet contamination” (droplet: very small drop of liquid) produced when individuals talk, sneeze, or cough. In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical “droplet precaution” to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, for asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks in public could easily cause the spread of COVID-19. The prevention of “environmental droplet contamination” (EnvDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote “public droplet safety,” we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal “community droplet reduction solution” is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8 m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 “social distancing.” All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30 cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10 cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a “community droplet reduction solution” (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks and surface covers) will reduce COVID-19 EnvDC and thus the risk of transmitting/acquiring COVID-19.</p>","COVID-19,Dermatology,Emergency Medicine,Family Care,Foetal Development and Medicine,Gastroenterology and Hepatology,Geriatrics and Gerontology,Intensive Care,Medical Genetics (excl.

For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift toward death was lower in the CHM plus group than in the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148–2.352, P = 0.454). Three (two from the CHM plus group and one from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 17.86% (5/28) vs. 14.29% (2/28), 71.43% (20/28) vs. 64.29% (9/28), and 0% (0) vs. 7.14% (1/28) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone.</p><p>Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

The impacts of the disease may be beyond the respiratory system, also affecting mental health. Several factors may be involved in the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes, such as fear inherent in the pandemic, adverse effects of treatments, as well as financial stress, and social isolation. Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes. Accordingly, we highlight here the hypothesis that neuroendocrine-immune interactions may be involved in negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection and social isolation on psychiatric issues.</p>","Animal Immunology,Applied Immunology (incl.

A few months later, this viral infection had spread worldwide and became a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, is multifactorial and associated with both specific antiviral as well as inflammatory responses, the extent of which may determine why some individuals are asymptomatic while others develop serious complications. Here we review possible life-threating immune events that can occur during disease progression to uncover key factors behind COVID-19 severity and provide suggestions for interventions with repurposed drugs in well-controlled and randomized clinical trials. These drugs include therapeutics with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells such as serine protease inhibitors of the cellular protease TMPS2 and drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system; antivirals with potential to block SARS-CoV-2 replication or factors that could boost the antiviral response; monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive the hyperinflammatory response during COVID-19 progression toward the severe stage and therapeutics that could ameliorate the function of the lungs. Furthermore, in order to help make more informed decisions on the timing of the intervention with the drugs listed in this review, we have grouped these therapeutics according to the stage of COVID-19 progression that we considered most appropriate for their mechanism of action.</p>","2019-nCoV,Animal Immunology,Applied Immunology (incl.

The presenting symptoms are mainly respiratory symptom, yet studies have reported nervous system involvement in the disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of these studies are required to understanding the neurologic characteristic of the disease and help physicians with early diagnosis and management.</p><p>Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the neurologic characteristics in patients with COVID-19.</p><p>Evidence Review: Authors conducted a literature search through PubMed from January 1st, 2020 to April 8th, 2020. Furthermore, the authors added additional sources by reviewing related references. Studies presenting the neurologic features of COVID-19 patients in their data were included. Case reports and case series were also included in this review. The quality of the studies was assessed based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines. Selected studies were included in the meta-analysis of proportion and the heterogeneity test.</p><p>Finding: From 280 identified studies, 33 were eligible, with 7,559 participants included. Most of the included studies were from China (29 [88%]).

1476,figshare12436205,Table_1_Main Clinical Features of COVID-19 and Potential Prognostic and Therapeutic Value of the Microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 Infections.docx,"<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a pandemic, infecting more than 4,000,000 people worldwide. This review describes the main clinical features of COVID-19 and potential role of microbiota in COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 79.5% nucleotide sequence identity and use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells. The distribution of ACE2 may determine how SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory and digestive tract. SARS and COVID-19 share similar clinical features, although the estimated fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower. The communication between the microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 and the role of this association in diagnosis and treatment are unclear. Changes in the lung microbiota were identified in COVID-19 patients, and the enrichment of the lung microbiota with bacteria found in the intestinal tract is correlated with the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome and long-term outcomes. ACE2 regulates the gut microbiota by indirectly controlling the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, the gut microbiota enhances antiviral immunity by increasing the number and function of immune cells, decreasing immunopathology, and stimulating interferon production. In turn, respiratory viruses are known to influence microbial composition in the lung and intestine. Therefore, the analysis of changes in the microbiota during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help predict patient outcomes and allow the development of microbiota-based therapies.</p>","ACE2,COVID-19,Microbial Ecology,Microbial Genetics,Microbiology,Mycology,SARS-CoV-2,SCFAs,microbiota",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1481,figshare12445691,Table_1_Lack of Association Between Genetic Variants at ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Genes Involved in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Human Quantitative Phenotypes.XLSX,"<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide variation in expression and severity of symptoms, from very mild or no symptoms, to flu-like symptoms, and in more severe cases, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death. Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection depends on two human genes: the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual's genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as usage of 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population cohort, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed several interesting suggestive associations. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the TMPRSS2 genes were associated with thrombocytes count (p = 1.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). SNPs within the ACE2 gene were associated with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p = 5.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), an association that is significantly stronger in females (p<sub>dif</sub><sub>f</sub> = 0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p = 5.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants could play a role in diseases such as thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases.

1509,figshare7937462,Towards a solution to MERS: protective human monoclonal antibodies targeting different domains and functions of the MERS-coronavirus spike glycoprotein,"<p>The Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus that causes severe and often fatal respiratory disease in humans. Efforts to develop antibody-based therapies have focused on neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein thereby blocking receptor binding. Here, we developed a set of human monoclonal antibodies that target functionally distinct domains of the MERS-CoV spike protein. These antibodies belong to six distinct epitope groups and interfere with the three critical entry functions of the MERS-CoV spike protein: sialic acid binding, receptor binding and membrane fusion. Passive immunization with potently as well as with poorly neutralizing antibodies protected mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Collectively, these antibodies offer new ways to gain humoral protection in humans against the emerging MERS-CoV by targeting different spike protein epitopes and functions.</p>","Biochemistry,Biophysics,Cancer,Coronavirus,Genetics,Hematology,Immunology,Infectious Diseases,MERS,Mental Health,Virology,antibodies,spike protein",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complex was placed in the cubic boxes with explicit TIP3P water models that have 10.0 &Aring; thickness from surfaces of protein. The system is&nbsp;neutralized by adding counter ions, and salt solution of 0.15M NaCl was also used to adjust the concentration of the systems. The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated by the particle mesh Ewald method. A cutoff<br>
radius of 9.0 &Aring; was used for both van der Waals and Coulombic interactions. The temperature was set as 310K initially, and Nose&ndash;Hoover thermostat was used for adjustment. Martyna&ndash;Tobias&ndash;Klein protocol was employed to control the pressure, which was set at 1.01325 bar. The time-step was assigned as 2.0 fs. The default values were used for minimization and equilibration steps, and finally 500 ns&nbsp;production run was performed for the simulation.</p>

Modelling predictions show that this pandemic will not stop on its own and that stringent migitation strategies are needed. Switzerland has implemented a series of measures both at cantonal and federal level. On March 16, 2020 the Federal Council of Switzerland declared &ldquo;extraordinary situation&rdquo; and introduced a series of stringent measures. This includes the closure of schools, restaurants, bars, businesses with close contact (e.g. hair dressers), entertainment or leisure facilities. Incoming cross-border mobility from specific countries is also restricted to Swiss citizens, residency holders or work commuters. As of March 20, 2020 mass gatherings of more than five people are also banned. Already in early March various cantons had started to ban events of various sizes and have restricted or banned access to short- and long-term care facilites and day care centers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to collect and categorize these control measures implemented and provide a continously updated data set, which can be used for modelling or visualization purposes. Please use the newest version available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We collect the date/duration and level of the most important measures taken in response to COVID-19 from official cantonal and federal press releases.

To fully understand the transmission and evolution of the virus requires sequencing and analysing viral genomes at scale and speed. The numbers of samples calls for a rapid increase in the UK&rsquo;s pathogen genome sequencing capacity rapidly and robustly. To provide this increased capacity to collect, sequence and analyse the whole genomes of virus samples in the UK, the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium is pooling the world-leading knowledge and expertise in genomics of the four UK Public Health Agencies, multiple regional University hubs, and large sequencing centres such as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.</p>

<br>
<strong>Abstract:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Background<br>
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with Europe and the USA at its epicenter. Little is known about risk factors for progression to severe disease in Europe. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in a Swiss university hospital.</p>

<p>Methods<br>
This retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records. The primary outcome was the need to mechanical ventilation at day 14.&nbsp; We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mechanical ventilation. Follow-up was of at least 14 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Results<br>
200 patients were included, of whom 37 (18&middot;5%) needed mechanical ventilation at 14 days. The median time from symptoms onset to mechanical ventilation was 9&middot;5 days (IQR 7.00, 12.75). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation in males (3.26, 1.21-9.8; p=0.025), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score &ge;2 (6.02, 2.09-18.82; p=0.001), with bilateral infiltrate (5.75, 1.91-21.06; p=0.004) or with a CRP of 40 mg/l or greater (4.73, 1.51-18.58; p=0.013).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Conclusions<br>
This study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex, high qSOFA score, CRP of 40 mg/l or greater and a bilateral radiological infiltrate could help clinicians identify patients at high risk for mechanical ventilation.</p>","COVID-19,Mechanical Ventilation,SARS-CoV-2,Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1593,zenodo.3788733,Why has the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Africa been insignificant compared to other regions? A descriptive analysis,"<p>Method</p>

<p>The dataset contains several confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, and death rate in six regions. The objective of the study&nbsp;is to compare the number of confirmed cases in Africa&nbsp;to other regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Death rate = Total number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the Total Number&nbsp;of infected patients.</p>

<p>The study&nbsp;provides evidence for the country-level in six regions by&nbsp;the World Health Organisation&#39;s classification.</p>

<p>Findings</p>

<p>Based on the descriptive data provided above, we conclude that the lack of tourism is one of the key reasons why COVID-19 reported cases are low in Africa compared to other regions. We also justified this claim by providing evidence from the economic freedom index, which indicates that the vast majority of African countries recorded a low index for a business environment. On the other hand, we conclude that the death rate is higher in the African region compared to other regions. This points to issues concerning health-care expenditure, low capacity for testing for COVID-19, and poor infrastructure in the region.</p>

<p>Apart from COVID-19, there are significant pre-existing diseases, namely; Malaria, Flu, HIV/AIDS, and Ebola in the continent. This study, therefore, invites the leaders to invest massively in the health-care system, infrastructure, and human capital in order to provide a sustainable environment for today and future generations. Lastly, policy uncertainty has been a major issue in determining a sustainable development goal on the continent. This uncertainty has differentiated Africa to other regions in terms of stepping up in the time of global crisis.</p>

<p>Molecular dynamics simulation trajectories (320ns each) have been performed using the Amber&nbsp;ff14SB&nbsp;force field running with the Amber18 package at the&nbsp;the&nbsp;NSF-funded (OAC-1826915, OAC-1828163) ELSA high performance computing cluster at The College of New Jersey.&nbsp;Under the following simulation methodology:</p>

<p><em>All-atom simulations were carried out with Amber18 (<a href=https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fambermd.org"">ambermd.org</a>)", and system components (protein, ions, water) were modeled with the included FF14SB and TIP3P parameter sets. Energy minimization used CPU pmemd," while later simulation stages used GPU pmemd. CoV2 and CoV1 systems with one RBD up (with/without ACE2) were solvated in 12 angstrom water shells. Cysteine residues identified in the initial models as having a disulfide bond (DB) were bonded using tLeap. All simulations used 0.150 M NaCl. Hydrogen mass repartitioning was applied only to the protein to enable a 4 fs timestep (<a href=""https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubs.acs.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1021%2Fct5010406"">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct5010406</a>). The SHAKE algorithm was applied to hydrogens", and a real-space cutoff of 8 angstroms was used. Periodic boundary conditions were applied and PME was used for long-range electrostatics. Minimization was by steepest descent (2000 steps) followed by conjugate gradient (3000 steps). Heating used two stages: (1) NVT heating from 0 K to 100 K (50 ps), and (2) NPT heating from 100 K to 300 K (100 ps). Restraints of 10 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;angstrom<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;were applied during minimization and heating to C-alpha atoms. During 6 ns of equilibration at 300 K C-alpha restraints were gradually reduced from 10 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;angstrom<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;to 0.1 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;angstrom<sup>-2</sup>. Finally, restraints were released and 320 ns unrestrained production simulations were carried out for CoV2 and CoV1 systems. Production simulations began from the final equilibrated snapshots, and five copies of each system were simulated. As unrestrained systems can freely rotate we monitored simulations for any close contacts and found that in one copy of the CoV1 simulation without ACE2 and one RBD up that a few contacts close to 8 angstrom occur near the end of the 320 ns between the RBD and a different subdomain of the spike complex in a periodic image. However this did not influence analyzed structural properties which is verified by comparing results across simulations. The Monte Carlo barostat was used to maintain pressure (1 atm), and the Langevin thermostat was used to maintain 300 K temperature (collision frequency 1 ps<sup>-1</sup>), as implemented in Amber18. In aggregate, nearly 7 microseconds of simulation of systems ranging from 396,147 to 879,100 atoms was carried out for this work.</em><br>,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 has transformed societies across the world as governments tackle the health, economic and social costs of the pandemic. It has also raised concerns about the spread of hateful language and prejudice online, especially hostility directed against East Asia. This data repository is for&nbsp;&nbsp;a classifier that detects and categorizes social media posts from Twitter into four classes: Hostility against East Asia, Criticism of East Asia, Meta-discussions of East Asian prejudice and a neutral class. The classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 across all four classes. We provide our final model (coded in Python), as well as a new 20,000 tweet training dataset used to make the classifier, two analyses of hashtags associated with East Asian prejudice and the annotation codebook. The classifier can be implemented by other researchers, assisting with both online content moderation processes and further research into the dynamics, prevalence and impact of East Asian prejudice online during this global pandemic.</p>

1614,zenodo.3842180,A large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter dataset for open scientific research - an international collaboration,"<p><strong>Due to the relevance of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we are releasing our dataset of tweets acquired from the Twitter Stream related to COVID-19 chatter. Since our first release we have received additional data from our new collaborators, allowing this resource to grow to its current size. Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th yielding over 4 million tweets a day. We have added additional data provided by our new collaborators from January 27th to March 27th, to provide extra longitudinal coverage. Version 10 added&nbsp;~1.5 million tweets in the Russian language collected between January 1st and May 8th, gracefully provided to us by:&nbsp;Katya Artemova (NRU HSE) and Elena Tutubalina (KFU).</strong></p>

<p><strong>The data collected from the stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are:&nbsp; English, Spanish, and French. We release all tweets and retweets on the full_dataset.tsv file (336,475,242&nbsp;unique tweets), and a cleaned version with no retweets on the full_dataset-clean.tsv file (81,966,398</strong><strong>&nbsp;unique tweets). There are several practical reasons for us to leave the retweets, tracing important tweets and their dissemination is one of them. For NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms in frequent_terms.csv, the top 1000 bigrams in frequent_bigrams.csv, and the top 1000 trigrams in frequent_trigrams.csv. Some general statistics per day are included for both datasets in the statistics-full_dataset.tsv and statistics-full_dataset-clean.tsv files.

1672,zenodo.3763421,Lung ultrasonography features and risk stratification in 80 patients with COVID-19: a prospective observational cohort study,"<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) is a promising and pragmatic risk stratification tool in COVID-19. This study describes and compares early LUS characteristics across of range of clinical outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Method</strong></p>

<p>Prospective observational study of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the emergency department (ED) of Lausanne University Hospital. A trained physician recorded LUS images using a standardized protocol. Two experts retrospectively reviewed images blinded to patient outcome. We describe and compare early LUS findings (acquired within 24hours of presentation at the ED) between patient groups based on their outcome at 7-days after inclusion:&nbsp; 1) self-resolving outpatients, 2) hospitalised and 3) intubated/death. The LUS score was used to discriminate between groups.</p>

<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>

<p>Between March 6 and April 3 2020, we included 80 patients (18 outpatients, 41 hospitalized and 21 intubated/dead). 73 patients (91%) had abnormal LUS (72% outpatients, 95% hospitalised and 100% intubated/death; p=0.004). The proportion of involved zones was lower in outpatients compared with other groups (median&nbsp; 30% [IQR 0-40%], 44% [33-70%] and 70% [50-88%], p&lt;0.001). Predominant abnormal patterns were bilateral and multifocal spread thickening of the pleura with pleural line irregularities (77%), confluent B lines (66%) and pathologic B lines (55%). Posterior inferior zones were more often affected. Median LUS score had a good level of discrimination between outpatients and others with area under the ROC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66-0.95).</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

1677,zenodo.3783510,"The transcriptomic profiling of COVID-19 compared to  SARS, MERS, Ebola, and H1N1","<p><strong>COVID-19 </strong>pandemic is a global crisis that threatens our way of life. As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~7% and recovery rate of ~30%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The <em>NRCAM</em>&nbsp;and <em>SAA2</em>&nbsp;that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and <em>FGF1</em>&nbsp;and <em>FOXO1</em>genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the <em>IL-8</em>, <em>IL-6</em>, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was <em>SERPINB1</em>. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.</p>

1679,zenodo.3783636,Not only pulmonary rehabilitation for critically ill patients with COVID-19,"<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Prolonged immobility in COVID-19 patients in mechanical ventilation combined with the infection-mediated harmful immune response can be responsible of peripheral nervous system complications, such as Intensive Care Unit Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW). We report preliminary findings of our monocentric prospective study.</p>

<p><strong>Method</strong></p>

<p>Prospective observational study of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients in mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit of Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi (Firenze).&nbsp;We evaluated: 1. muscle power grading on motor response to nociceptive stimuli by means of MRC; 2. nerve conduction velocities, compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) of six motor and four sensitive nerves in bilateral upper and lower limbs; 3. spontaneous muscle activity in bilateral tibialis anterior and biceps by needle. The presence of combined critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) was defined by very low amplitude of CMAP and/or SNAP on neurophysiological evaluation with normal or mildly reduced nerve conduction velocities, combined with myopathic features on needle electromyography.&nbsp;Data about pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension were also collected.</p>

<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>

<p>Between March 23 March 2020 to 10 April 2020, we performed ENG studies in 9 patients. Based on clinical examination&nbsp;ICU-AW (MRC score &lt;48/60) was present in all 9 patients. Four of them had diagnosis of CIPNM at neurophysiological evaluation, and 3 of the remaining 5 patients presented neurophysiological findings consistent with common peroneal nerve compression</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>The present findings suggest that in critically ill patients affected by COVID-19 functional motor deficits are highly prevalent and should be searched for. ICU-AW have been found to negatively affect weaning from mechanical ventilation long-term outcome&nbsp;and increase in-hospital mortality of critical patients. Early recognition of these complications could help clinicians to plan an appropriate neuromotor rehabilitation (e.g. by early passive limbs mobilization and posture changes) for improving respiratory function and clinical outcome.</p>

We applied a backcasting approach, coupled with Monte Carlo methods, to estimate a distribution for the true (population) cumulative number of infections (infected and recovered) for 15 countries where reliable data are available. We find a positive relationship between the testing rate per 1,000 people and the implied true detection rate of COVID-19, and a negative relationship between the proportion who test positive and the implied true detection rate. Our estimates suggest that the true number of people infected across our sample of 15 developed countries is 18.2 (5-95% CI: 11.9-39.0) times greater than the reported number of cases. In individual countries, the true number of cases exceeds the reported figure by factors that range from 1.7 (5-95% CI: 1.1-3.6) for Australia to 35.6 (5-95% CI: 23.2-76.3) for Belgium.</p>","COVID-19,SARS-CoV-2,disease detection rate,pandemic,public health",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<br>
<strong>Background</strong>:<br>
In the treatment for severe ARDS from COVID-19, the WHO recommends prone positioning (PP) during mechanical ventilation for periods of 12-16 hours per day to potentially improve oxygenation and survival. In this prospective observational study we evaluated the ability of long PP sessions to improve oxygenation in awake ICU patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong>:<br>
The study was approved by the ethics committee of Galicia (code No. 2020-188), and all patients provided informed consent. In this case series, awake patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID-19 admitted to the ICU at University Hospital of Santiago from March 21 to April 5, 2020 were prospectively analyzed. Patients were instructed to remain in PP as long as possible and not stop until the they felt too tired to maintain that position. If needed, light sedation was administered. The following information were collected: StO2 and blood gases (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2, PaCO2, pH) in ICU admission, number and duration of PP sessions, StO2 and blood gases before, during and following a PP session, need of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission and ICU outcome. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) were adjusted to estimate changes of oxygenation parameters from baseline,. Patients were added as a random effect to account for inter-patient random variability in their own baseline measurements.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>:<br>
Seven patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID-19 were included. All patients received at least one PP session. A total of 16 PP sessions were performed in the 7 patients during the period study. The median duration of PP sessions was 10 hours. For PP sessions of more than 4 hours, dexmedetomidine was used for sedation. Oxygenation increased in all sixteen sessions performed in the seven patients. Prone positioning was associated to a net increase from baseline in PaO2, PaO2/FiO2 and StO2 (65, mmHg 110 and 2.6% respectively) PaO2/FiO2 increased during PP (&Delta; PaO2/FiO2 110.42 mmHg [28.173; 192.67]) and after PP (37.75 [-1.57; 77.07] compared with previous supine position (baseline PaO2FiO2 median-IQR97.8 [97.2 &ndash; 99.4]). Two patients required intubation. Six patients were discharged from the ICU and one remains on mechanical ventilation.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>:<br>
We found that PP improved oxygenation and may avoid intubation in ICU patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS. PP was relatively well tolerated in our patients. and may be a simple strategy to improve oxygenation trying to reduce patients in mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
