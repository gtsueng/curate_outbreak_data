The model was trained just on locations in <em>Italy </em>that have reported a rate of new infections higher than the geometric mean of all Italian infection rates. The following environmental parameters were used, which are correlated to those used by other studies: 

<ul>
	<li>Average Annual Surface Air Temperature in 2018 (NASA)</li>
	<li>Average Annual Precipitation in 2018 (NASA)</li>
	<li>CO2 emission (natural+artificial) averaged between January 1979 and December 2013 (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service)</li>
	<li>Elevation (NOAA ETOPO2)</li>
	<li>Population per 0.5° cell (NASA Gridded Population of the World)</li>
</ul>

A higher resolution map, the model file (in ASC format) and all parameters used are also attached. 

The model indicates highest correlation with <em>infection rate</em> for CO2 around 0.03 gCm^−2day^−1, for Temperature around 11.8 °C, and for Precipitation around 0.3 kg m^-2  s^-1, whereas Elevation and Population density are poorly correlated with <em>infection rate</em>. 

<strong>One interesting result is that the model indicates, among others, the Hubei region in China as a high-probability location</strong>, <strong>and Iran (around Teheran) as a suited location for virus' spread, but the model was not trained on these regions, i.e. it did not know about the actual spread in these regions.</strong> "
figshare12019035	Risk Factors	4	5	0.8	Clinical	"['Mechanism', 'Treatment']"	Both	Why blood group A individuals are at risk whereas blood group O individuals might be protected from SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection: A hypothesis regarding how the virus invades the human body via ABO(H) blood group-determining carbohydrates	"Infection does not mean disease because for uncountable reasons the invasion of a pathogen does not always lead to disease
symptoms. The molecular biology of a virus infection pathogenesis determines the genetic target and the human phenotype-determining enzymes decide about the difference between infection and disease. In the case that <i>O</i>-glycosylation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections, as was discussed already 14 years ago in a SARS-CoV virus infection and is currently again predicted for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, this would involve the formation of hybrid, serologically A-like, <i>O</i>-GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr-R, Tn (“T nouvelle”) antigenic structures. Although the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2) protein is defined as the primary SARS-CoV receptor, it is the history of the amino acid serine, suggesting the actual or additional binding via an intermediate hybrid <i>O</i>-glycan: the TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine subtype 2) host protease-mobilized, virus-encoded serine molecule gets access to the host's N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) metabolism and the resulting intermediate, hybrid A-like/Tn structure performs the adhesion of the virus to host cells primarily independent of the ABO blood group, while the phenotype-determining sugars become the final glycosidic target. Individuals with blood group A and B cannot respond with preformed innate antibodies to the synthesis of A-like/Tn structures due to phenotypic accommodation of plasma proteins but perform a further (blood group-A- and/or B-specific) hybrid binding, most likely causing autoimmune reactions. A first statistical study suggests that people with blood group A have a significantly higher risk for acquiring COVID-19, whereas people with blood group O have a significantly lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups (Zhao, J. <i>et al., 2020). </i>SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) infections may be considered an evolutionary selective disease, contributing to the present-day world distribution of the human ABO(H) blood groups, which has arisen through blood group-related life-threatening
diseases<sup> </sup>over millions of years. While the synthesis of the blood group AB enables the strongest contact with a pathogen and molecularly precluding any isoagglutinin activity, makes this group the least protected and the smallest among the ABO blood groups, blood group O(H) individuals develop the least contact with the pathogen; maintaining the isoagglutinins, they rarer develop severe disease and survive this coevolution in an immunological balance with a pathogen as the largest blood group worldwide. However, it might be speculated that for an unknown period of time they remain pathogen carriers and belong to the main drivers of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. <i> </i>  <b>Reference</b>: Zhao, J. <i>et al.</i> Relationship between the ABO Blood Group and the COVID-19 Susceptibility. <i>medRxiv</i> (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096.

figshare12082035	Classical epidemiology	2	3	0.666666667	Epidemiology	"['Mechanism', 'Transmission', 'Environment']"	Algorithm	The codon usage pattern of the novel coronavirus	"The current outbreak of a novel <a>coronavirus </a>(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is spreading rapidly across the whole world. The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) to be a global pandemic. COVID-19 is milder, less fatal than SARS and MERS, but SARS-CoV-2 poses more serious threats to public health, because it is highly contagious and has a high potential of causing severe-acute, life-threatening pneumonia. Here we analyzed the similarities of codon usages between humans and different viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and coronavirus (CoV). The codon usages of HPAIs are highly similar to that of humans. In contrast, the codon usage of HIVs and CoVs is less and the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 is the least similar to that of humans among all viruses tested. Besides, human-preferred codons are adopted to substitute less-preferred ones in SARS-CoV; in SARS-CoV-2, however, human-preferred codons are replaced by less-preferred ones.
The unique codon usage pattern suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was probably formed by evolving in an unusual intermediate host over a long period, in which its codon usage became drastically
different from that of humans and those of other pathogenic viruses. Moreover, its pathogenicity is weakened compared with SARS-CoV, but it becomes more potent and may gain higher potentials in the future. Therefore, there is an urgent need to block the transmission routes among humans, search for the origin and intermediate hosts of the coronaviruses, and prevent any future outbreaks."

We utilized this dataset to produce, for each article, the values of the following impact measures: 

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>Influence:</strong></em> Citation-based measure reflecting the total impact of an article. This is based on the PageRank<sup>3</sup> network analysis method. In the context of citation networks, it estimates the importance of each article based on its centrality in the whole network.

	<li><em><strong>Popularity:</strong></em> Citation-based measure reflecting the current impact of an article. This is based on the RAM<sup>5</sup> citation network analysis method. Methods like PageRank are biased against recently published articles (new articles need time to receive their first citations). RAM alleviates this problem using an approach known as ""time-awareness"". This is why it is more suitable to capture the current ""hype"" of an article. This measure was calculated using the PaperRanking (<a href=""https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking"">https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking</a>) library<sup>4</sup>.</li>
	<li><em><strong>Social Media Attention: </strong></em>The number of tweets related to this article.

Rational use requires: (1) modification of the clozapine package insert worldwide to include lower doses for Asians and to avoid the lethality associated with pneumonia, (2) the use of clozapine levels for personalizing dosing, and (3) the use of slow and personalized titration. This may make clozapine as safe as possible and contribute to increased life expectancy and well-being. In the absence of data on COVID-19 in clozapine patients, clozapine possibly impairs immunological mechanisms and may increase pneumonia risk in infected patients. Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose. If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it. Once the signs of inflammation and fever have disappeared, the clozapine dose can be slowly increased to the prior dosage level."

<b>Study aims and methodology: </b>The novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV-2, is a transmissible viral
disease that has rapidly spread around the world and is currently a major threat for
developing and under poverty level countries according to World Bank's and WHO's
prediction. At the moment, there is no vaccine or effective treatment to
prevent the spread of the virus. However, the policies “self-isolation”,
“quarantine”, “lock-down” and “social distancing”, that have been introduced in
many countries around the world, aim to control the severity of the outbreak. This
paper introduces a novel theoretical model named Social distancing SEIQR
model, to control the spread of infection by combining both quarantine and
social distancing explicitly based on the real cases observed, in countries where
medical equipment and other resources are limited. 

  

The SEIQR
social distancing model is based on six assumptions or facts. The basic
reproduction number R0, was used to assess the transmissibility of COVID-19.

figshare12219572	Classical epidemiology	3	3	1	Epidemiology	"['Prevention', 'Forecasting']"	Both	Table_1_Covid-19: A Dynamic Analysis of Fatality Risk in Italy.xlsx	"Italy was the second country in the world to face a wide epidemic of Covid-19 after China. The ratio of the number of fatalities to the number of cases (case fatality ratio, CFR) recorded in Italy was surprisingly high and increased in the month of March. The older mean age of population, the changes in testing policy, and the methodological computation of CFR were previously reported as possible explanations for the incremental trend of CFR, a parameter theoretically expected to be constant. In this brief report, the official data provided by the Italian Ministry of Health were analyzed using fitting models and the linear fit method approach. This last methodology allowed us to reach two findings. The trend of the number of deaths followed a 1–3-day delay of positive cases. This delay was not compatible with a biological course of Covid-19 but was compatible with a health management explanation. The second finding is that the Italian number of deaths did not increase linearly with the number of positive cases, but their relationship could be modeled by a second-order polynomial function. The high number of positive cases might have a direct and an indirect effect on the number of deaths, the latter being related to the overwhelmed bed capacity of intensive care units. "

An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with a similar total population number to Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the mean of basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was 4.34 (95% CI, 3.04–6.00) in Italy and 3.16 (95% CI, 1.73–5.25) in Hunan. There would be a total of 182 051 infected cases (95%CI:116 114–274 378) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Aug 05 in Italy. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures should be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies. "

The dataset contains several confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, and death rate in six regions. The objective of the study is to compare the number of confirmed cases in Africa to other regions.  

Death rate = Total number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the Total Number of infected patients. 

The study provides evidence for the country-level in six regions by the World Health Organisation's classification. 

Findings 

Based on the descriptive data provided above, we conclude that the lack of tourism is one of the key reasons why COVID-19 reported cases are low in Africa compared to other regions. We also justified this claim by providing evidence from the economic freedom index, which indicates that the vast majority of African countries recorded a low index for a business environment. On the other hand, we conclude that the death rate is higher in the African region compared to other regions. This points to issues concerning health-care expenditure, low capacity for testing for COVID-19, and poor infrastructure in the region. 

Apart from COVID-19, there are significant pre-existing diseases, namely; Malaria, Flu, HIV/AIDS, and Ebola in the continent. This study, therefore, invites the leaders to invest massively in the health-care system, infrastructure, and human capital in order to provide a sustainable environment for today and future generations. Lastly, policy uncertainty has been a major issue in determining a sustainable development goal on the continent. This uncertainty has differentiated Africa to other regions in terms of stepping up in the time of global crisis.

This is a question that billions of people are wondering early 2020 due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This virus can produce a severe pneumonia that has killed over 230,000 people so far, was detected for the first time late 2019 in Wuhan (China), and has spread all over the world due, in part, to the difficulty of detecting and isolating asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic cases. In this paper, we explore how long suppression strategies (i.e., home confinement and social distancing) must be put into practice in highly populated cities to reduce the chances that a quick rebound of COVID-19 infections occur again over the next months. This is explored, using New York City (USA), San Francisco (USA), and Madrid (Spain) as case studies, through a simple but realistic Monte Carlo stochastic model that takes into account that part of the undetected infected individuals remain in circulation propagating the virus. Our simulations reflect that, if suppression strategies are not properly applied, they can be counterproductive because there are high chances that the confinement time has to be lengthened without reducing the total number of infections. We also estimate that, in the most conservative scenario and under the model assumptions, home confinement is effective if applied at least ~110 days in New York City, ~80 days in San Francisco, and ~70 days in Madrid, i.e., until mid-July 2020, early June 2020, and late May 2020, respectively.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has attracted the attention of the whole world. Our study aimed to describe illness progression and risk profiles for mortality in non-survivors. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 155 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and focused on 18 non-survivors among them. Briefly, we compared the dynamic profile of biochemical and immune parameters and drew an epidemiological and clinical picture of disease progression from disease onset to death in non-survivors. The survival status of the cohort was indicated by a Kaplan–Meier curve. Results. Of the non-survivors, the median age was 73.5 years, and the proportion of males was 72.2%. Five and 13 patients were hospital-acquired and community-acquired infection of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The interval between disease onset and diagnosis was 8.5 days (IQR, [4–11]). With the deterioration of disease, most patients experienced consecutive changes in biochemical parameters, including lymphopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, as well as elevated D-dimer and procalcitonin. Regarding the immune dysregulation, patients exhibited significantly decreased T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, including CD3<sup>+</sup>T, CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>Th, and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>Tc cells. By the end of the disease, most patients suffered from severe complications, including ARDS (17/18; 94.4%), acute cardiac injury (10/18; 55.6%), acute kidney injury (7/18; 38.9%), shock (6/18; 33.3%), gastrointestinal bleeding (1/18; 5.6%), as well as perforation of intestine (1/18; 5.6%). All patients died within 45 days after the initial hospital admission with a median survivor time of 13.5 days (IQR, 8–17). Conclusions.

In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical “droplet precaution” to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, for asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks in public could easily cause the spread of COVID-19. The prevention of “environmental droplet contamination” (EnvDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote “public droplet safety,” we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal “community droplet reduction solution” is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8 m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 “social distancing.” All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30 cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10 cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a “community droplet reduction solution” (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks and surface covers) will reduce COVID-19 EnvDC and thus the risk of transmitting/acquiring COVID-19.

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) was also included as part of the treatment plans at various stages of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized, controlled trial in patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Eligible adult patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either CHM plus standard care or standard care alone for 7 days. The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment. Results: Between Jan 31, 2020, and Feb 19, 2020, 42 out of 100 screened patients were included in the trial: 28 in the CHM plus standard care group and 14 in the standard care alone group. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]), 21 (21/42, 50%) were aged ≥65 years, 35 (35/42, 83%) were women, and 42 (42/42, 100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift toward death was lower in the CHM plus group than in the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148–2.352, P = 0.454). Three (two from the CHM plus group and one from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 17.86% (5/28) vs. 14.29% (2/28), 71.43% (20/28) vs. 64.29% (9/28), and 0% (0) vs. 7.14% (1/28) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone. Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The effects of CHM in COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies. Clinical Trial Registration:http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx.

The impacts of the disease may be beyond the respiratory system, also affecting mental health. Several factors may be involved in the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes, such as fear inherent in the pandemic, adverse effects of treatments, as well as financial stress, and social isolation. Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes. Accordingly, we highlight here the hypothesis that neuroendocrine-immune interactions may be involved in negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection and social isolation on psychiatric issues. "

In such a context, it becomes imperative that resources are used in the most humane ways possible; and that decisions about resource allocation are made carefully and with compassion.   While there are a number of key resource allocation decisions that need to be made in the response to COVID-19, this rapid economic evaluation responds to the question: What is the cost-effectiveness of ICU care versus treatment in general ward in supporting severe COVID-19 cases? Given the emergent nature of COVID-19 and the huge uncertainty in key parameters, a simple excel-based model is provided. This simplicity is designed to facilitate understanding. In addition, the framework allows for parameters to be varied and ultimately updated as sufficient local data become available. "

A lockdown from 24 March was partially relaxed on 10 May. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods: Office for National Statistics data on deaths in England and Wales is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R<sub>0</sub> and forecasts for cases and deaths. Results: The UK initial log growth rate is r = 0.254 with s.e. 0.004. R<sub>0</sub> = 6.94 with 95% CI (6.52, 7.39). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced throughout to 5% of their previous values, peaks of around 90,000 severely and 25,000 critically ill patients, and 44,000 cumulative deaths are expected by 16 June. With transmission rising from 5% in mid-April to reach 30%, 50,000 deaths and 475,000 active cases are expected in mid-June. Had such a lockdown begun on 17 March, around 30,000 (28,000, 32,000) fewer cumulative deaths would be expected by 9 June. Discussion: The R<sub>0</sub> estimate is compatible with some international estimates but over twice the value quoted by the UK government. An earlier lockdown could have saved many thousands of lives. "

Since then, several countries went into lockdown. Using a mechanistic-statistical formalism, we estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number R<sub>e</sub> of the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (R<sub>e</sub> = 0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45–0.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0–4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of R<sub>e</sub> is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities.

Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection depends on two human genes: the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual's genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as usage of 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population cohort, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed several interesting suggestive associations. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the TMPRSS2 genes were associated with thrombocytes count (p = 1.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). SNPs within the ACE2 gene were associated with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p = 5.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), an association that is significantly stronger in females (p<sub>dif</sub><sub>f</sub> = 0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p = 5.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants could play a role in diseases such as thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability. Full results are available at https://covid19research.nl.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by a rapid onset of generalized inflammation, is the leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19. We thus aimed to explore the effect of risk factors on the severity of the disease, focusing on immune-inflammatory parameters, which represent the immune status of patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search for relevant studies published up to April 2020 was performed by using the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) databases. After extracting all available data of immune-inflammatory indicators, we statistically analyzed the risk factors of severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients with a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 4,911 patients from 29 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that severe patients tend to present with increased white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and a decreased number of total lymphocyte and lymphocyte subtypes, such as CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD8+ T lymphocyte, compared to the non-severe patients. In addition, the WBC count>10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, lymphocyte count<1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, PCT>0.5 ng/mL, and CRP>10 mg/L were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (WBC count>10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L: OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.96–4.35; lymphocyte count<1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L: OR = 4.97, 95% CI: 3.53–6.99; PCT>0.5 ng/mL: OR = 6.33, 95% CI: 3.97–10.10; CRP>10 mg/L: OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 2.38–5.16).

Methods: We identified COVID-19 patients who admitted to Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital and presented with gastrointestinal symptoms as their initial or main symptoms. Their medical records were reviewed by two independent clinical scientists. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as the clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Among 142 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 7 (4.9%) of them presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Three patients had gastrointestinal symptoms as the initial symptoms and chief complaints, and 4 patients as the main symptoms during disease progression. Six patients had symptoms of diarrhea (3–16 days), 7 with anorexia (7–22 days), 6 with upper abdominal discomfort (1–7 days), and 4 with nausea (1–7 days), 1 with heartburn lasting 2 days, and 2 with vomiting symptoms (1 day). The chest CT scan showed typical COVID-19 imaging features, and associated with the progression of the disease. During treatment, 2 patients died due to organ failure. Discussion: COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively rare and might be misdiagnosed. The clinical features include watery stools, anorexia, and upper abdominal discomfort. These patients may have severe disease and be associated with a poor prognosis. The underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 related gastrointestinal symptoms need to clarify in future studies. "

Complex was placed in the cubic boxes with explicit TIP3P water models that have 10.0 &Aring; thickness from surfaces of protein. The system is&nbsp;neutralized by adding counter ions, and salt solution of 0.15M NaCl was also used to adjust the concentration of the systems. The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated by the particle mesh Ewald method. A cutoff 
radius of 9.0 &Aring; was used for both van der Waals and Coulombic interactions. The temperature was set as 310K initially, and Nose&ndash;Hoover thermostat was used for adjustment. Martyna&ndash;Tobias&ndash;Klein protocol was employed to control the pressure, which was set at 1.01325 bar. The time-step was assigned as 2.0 fs. The default values were used for minimization and equilibration steps, and finally 500 ns&nbsp;production run was performed for the simulation.

Modelling predictions show that this pandemic will not stop on its own and that stringent migitation strategies are needed. Switzerland has implemented a series of measures both at cantonal and federal level. On March 16, 2020 the Federal Council of Switzerland declared &ldquo;extraordinary situation&rdquo; and introduced a series of stringent measures. This includes the closure of schools, restaurants, bars, businesses with close contact (e.g. hair dressers), entertainment or leisure facilities. Incoming cross-border mobility from specific countries is also restricted to Swiss citizens, residency holders or work commuters. As of March 20, 2020 mass gatherings of more than five people are also banned. Already in early March various cantons had started to ban events of various sizes and have restricted or banned access to short- and long-term care facilites and day care centers.&nbsp; 

The aim of this project is to collect and categorize these control measures implemented and provide a continously updated data set, which can be used for modelling or visualization purposes. Please use the newest version available.&nbsp; 

We collect the date/duration and level of the most important measures taken in response to COVID-19 from official cantonal and federal press releases. A description of the measures, the levels as well as the newest version of data dataset can be found <a href=""https://github.com/baffelli/covid-2019-measures"">here</a>.&nbsp; "

As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~7% and recovery rate of ~30%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The <em>NRCAM</em>&nbsp;and <em>SAA2</em>&nbsp;that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and <em>FGF1</em>&nbsp;and <em>FOXO1</em>genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the <em>IL-8</em>, <em>IL-6</em>, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was <em>SERPINB1</em>. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.

Prolonged immobility in COVID-19 patients in mechanical ventilation combined with the infection-mediated harmful immune response can be responsible of peripheral nervous system complications, such as Intensive Care Unit Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW). We report preliminary findings of our monocentric prospective study. 

<strong>Method</strong> 

Prospective observational study of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients in mechanical ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit of Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi (Firenze).&nbsp;We evaluated: 1. muscle power grading on motor response to nociceptive stimuli by means of MRC; 2. nerve conduction velocities, compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) of six motor and four sensitive nerves in bilateral upper and lower limbs; 3. spontaneous muscle activity in bilateral tibialis anterior and biceps by needle. The presence of combined critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) was defined by very low amplitude of CMAP and/or SNAP on neurophysiological evaluation with normal or mildly reduced nerve conduction velocities, combined with myopathic features on needle electromyography.&nbsp;Data about pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension were also collected. 

<strong>Findings</strong> 

Between March 23 March 2020 to 10 April 2020, we performed ENG studies in 9 patients. Based on clinical examination&nbsp;ICU-AW (MRC score &lt;48/60) was present in all 9 patients. Four of them had diagnosis of CIPNM at neurophysiological evaluation, and 3 of the remaining 5 patients presented neurophysiological findings consistent with common peroneal nerve compression 

<strong>Interpretation</strong> 

The present findings suggest that in critically ill patients affected by COVID-19 functional motor deficits are highly prevalent and should be searched for. ICU-AW have been found to negatively affect weaning from mechanical ventilation long-term outcome&nbsp;and increase in-hospital mortality of critical patients. Early recognition of these complications could help clinicians to plan an appropriate neuromotor rehabilitation (e.g. by early passive limbs mobilization and posture changes) for improving respiratory function and clinical outcome.

The dataset contains several confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, and death rate in six regions. The objective of the study&nbsp;is to compare the number of confirmed cases in Africa&nbsp;to other regions.&nbsp; 

Death rate = Total number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by the Total Number&nbsp;of infected patients. 

The study&nbsp;provides evidence for the country-level in six regions by&nbsp;the World Health Organisation&#39;s classification. 

Findings 

Based on the descriptive data provided above, we conclude that the lack of tourism is one of the key reasons why COVID-19 reported cases are low in Africa compared to other regions. We also justified this claim by providing evidence from the economic freedom index, which indicates that the vast majority of African countries recorded a low index for a business environment. On the other hand, we conclude that the death rate is higher in the African region compared to other regions. This points to issues concerning health-care expenditure, low capacity for testing for COVID-19, and poor infrastructure in the region. 

Apart from COVID-19, there are significant pre-existing diseases, namely; Malaria, Flu, HIV/AIDS, and Ebola in the continent. This study, therefore, invites the leaders to invest massively in the health-care system, infrastructure, and human capital in order to provide a sustainable environment for today and future generations. Lastly, policy uncertainty has been a major issue in determining a sustainable development goal on the continent. This uncertainty has differentiated Africa to other regions in terms of stepping up in the time of global crisis.

<strong>Abstract:&nbsp;</strong> 

Background 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with Europe and the USA at its epicenter. Little is known about risk factors for progression to severe disease in Europe. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in a Swiss university hospital. 

Methods 
This retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records.

zenodo.3824950	Behavioral Research	2	3	0.666666667	Behavioral Research	['Information Sciences']	Algorithm	Digital Narratives of Covid-19: a Twitter Dataset	"We are releasing a Twitter dataset connected to our project <a href=""https://covid.dh.miami.edu/""><em>Digital Narratives of Covid-19</em> </a>(DHCOVID) that -among other goals- aims to explore during one year (May 2020-2021) the narratives behind data about the coronavirus pandemic. 
In this first version, we deliver a Twitter dataset organized as follows: 
<ul>
	<li>Each folder corresponds to daily data (one folder for each day): YEAR-MONTH-DAY</li>
	<li>In every folder there are 9 different plain text files named with &quot;dhcovid&quot;, followed by date (YEAR-MONTH-DAY), language (&quot;en&quot; for English, and &quot;es&quot; for Spanish), and region abbreviation (&quot;fl&quot;, &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;mx&quot;, &quot;co&quot;, &quot;pe&quot;, &quot;ec&quot;, &quot;es&quot;):
	<ol>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_es_fl.txt: Dataset containing tweets geolocalized in South Florida. The geo-localization is tracked by tweet coordinates, by place, or by user information.</li>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_en_fl.txt: We are gathering only tweets in English that refer to the area of Miami and South Florida. The reason behind this choice is that there are multiple projects harvesting English data, and, our project is particularly interested in this area because of our home institution (University of Miami) and because we aim to study public conversations from a bilingual (EN/ES) point of view.</li>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_es_ar.txt: Dataset containing tweets from Argentina.</li>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_es_mx.txt: Dataset containing tweets from Mexico.</li>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_es_co.txt: Dataset containing tweets from Colombia.</li>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_es_pe.txt: Dataset containing tweets from Per&uacute;.</li>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_es_ec.txt: Dataset containing tweets from Ecuador.</li>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_es_es.txt: Dataset containing tweets from Spain.</li>
		<li>dhcovid_YEAR-MONTH-DAY_es.txt: This dataset contains all tweets in Spanish, regardless of its geolocation.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

For English, we collect all tweets with the following keywords and hashtags: covid, coronavirus, pandemic, quarantine, stayathome, outbreak, lockdown, socialdistancing. For Spanish, we search for:&nbsp;covid, coronavirus, pandemia, quarentena, confinamiento, quedateencasa, desescalada, distanciamiento social. 

The corpus of tweets consists of a list of Tweet Ids; to obtain the original tweets, you can use &quot;<a href=""https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator"">Twitter hydratator</a>&quot; which takes the id and download for you all metadata in a csv file. 

We started collecting this Twitter dataset on April 24th, 2020 and we are adding&nbsp;daily data to our GitHub repository. There is a detected problem with file 2020-04-24/dhcovid_2020-04-24_es.txt, which we couldn&#39;t gather the data due to technical reasons.
